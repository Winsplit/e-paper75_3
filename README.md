# e-paper75_3

This is my third "playing around" project with my e-paper display.

This time I added a motion detecter that prevents the display from refreshing when someone is close to the display, due to that the refreshing of the display is really annoying.

Some of my code I got from: https://github.com/Madelena/esphome-weatherman-dashboard

Weather forecast from HA integration OpenWeatherMap.
